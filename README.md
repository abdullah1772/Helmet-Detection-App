Exciting News: I have developed a Helmet Detection App! ðŸŽ‰
I'm thrilled to announce my latest project â€“ a cutting-edge Helmet Detection App! This application, leveraging the power of Ultralytics YOLOv8, integrates with a Flask API and HTML interface to efficiently detect helmet usage in real-time.
Here are four practical use cases where our app shines:
âœ… Construction Site Safety: Ensures all workers are adhering to safety regulations by wearing helmets on-site.
âœ… Traffic Law Enforcement: Assists traffic police in identifying motorcyclists riding without helmets, promoting road safety.
âœ… Industrial Area Monitoring: Enhances safety protocols in industrial settings by ensuring all personnel are wearing protective headgear.
âœ… Adventure Sports Compliance: Useful for adventure sports facilities to ensure participants' safety by monitoring helmet usage.
Stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out for a demo or collaboration opportunities!
